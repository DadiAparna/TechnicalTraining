#Types of object oriented programming

1.Abstract object oriented programming
2.Inheritance
3.Encapsulation
4.Polymorphism
5.Multi Threading
6.Exceptional handling

Inheritance: inherit properties from another class and then use them when required.

#Types of Inheritance:
1. Single
2. Multiple
3. Multi-level
4. Hierarchical
5. Hybrid
* Multipath

*Single Inheritance:class is derived only from a single parent class 

*multi-leve inheritance example:
   there is super class on the top and class is below that and under class there is a sub-class.

*Heirarchical - prioritized

*Hybrid inheritance satisfies more than one form of inheritance

*no condition that all attributes should be same in multi-level inheritance

->finding a number whether it is odd or even using single stance class

class number:
    even=0
    def check(self,num):
        if num%2 ==0:
            self.even=1
    def even_odd(self,num):
        self.check(num)
        if self.even==1:
            print(num, "iseven")
        else:
            print(num, "is odd")

n=number()
n.even_odd(21)

output is: 21 is odd
