#Difference between compiler and interpreter

compiler stands the entire program during the scanning process if any single bug is occurred,entire program was blocked.(c,c++)
In interpreter if anyline has an issue,it skip that line and executes the remaining code. (python,php,html,css,javascript,node.js,react.js)
  both compiler&interpreter (java)
